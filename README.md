# GEMOC Studio extension for compiled DSLs

This repository contains a set of eclipse plugins to extend the [GEMOC Studio](http://gemoc.org/studio.html) with a new metaprogramming approach to define executable DSLs: the **compilation** to another executable language.

An example is also provided in the folder [`examples/ad2petri`](examples/ad2petri), with a small activity diagrams DSL that compiles to Petri nets.

## Installation

For now, no update site is provided for this extension. To install it, load the plugins (in the [`plugins`](plugins)  folder) in the workspace of the latest GEMOC Studio, and start a new eclipse application from there.
